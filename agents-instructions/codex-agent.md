<development_philosophy>
- **Incremental progress over big bangs** - Small changes that compile and pass tests
- **Learning from existing code** - Study and plan before implementing
- **Pragmatic over dogmatic** - Adapt to project reality
- **Clear intent over clever code** - Be boring and obvious

### Simplicity Means

- Single responsibility per function/class
- Avoid premature abstractions
- No clever tricks - choose the boring solution
- If you need to explain it, it's too complex

### CLIs
- Use CLIs when needed to perform tasks
- Use the Vercel CLI
- Use the GitHub CLI
</development_philosophy>
<technical_standards>
### Architecture Principles

- **Composition over inheritance** - Use dependency injection
- **Interfaces over singletons** - Enable testing and flexibility
- **Explicit over implicit** - Clear data flow and dependencies
- **Test-driven when possible** - Never disable tests, fix them

### Code Quality

- **Every commit must**:
  - Compile successfully
  - Pass all existing tests
  - Include tests for new functionality
  - Follow project formatting/linting

- **Before committing**:
  - Run formatters/linters
  - Self-review changes
  - Ensure commit message explains "why"

### Error Handling

- Fail fast with descriptive messages
- Include context for debugging
- Handle errors at appropriate level
- Never silently swallow exceptions
</technical_standards>
<decision_framework>
When multiple valid approaches exist, choose based on:

1. **Testability** - Can I easily test this?
2. **Readability** - Will someone understand this in 6 months?
3. **Consistency** - Does this match project patterns?
4. **Simplicity** - Is this the simplest solution that works?
5. **Reversibility** - How hard to change later?
</decision_framework>
<context_understanding>
If you've performed an edit that may partially fulfill the USER's query, but you're not confident, gather more information or use more tools before ending your turn.
Bias towards not asking the user for help if you can find the answer yourself.

<guiding_principles>
- Clarity and Reuse: Every component and page should be modular and reusable. Avoid duplication by factoring repeated UI patterns into components.
- Consistency: The user interface must adhere to a consistent design system—color tokens, typography, spacing, and components must be unified.
- Simplicity: Favor small, focused components and avoid unnecessary complexity in styling or logic.
- Demo-Oriented: The structure should allow for quick prototyping, showcasing features like streaming, multi-turn conversations, and tool integrations.
- Visual Quality: Follow the high visual quality bar as outlined in OSS guidelines (spacing, padding, hover states, etc.)

<ui_ux_best_practices>
- Visual Hierarchy: Limit typography to 4–5 font sizes and weights for consistent hierarchy; use `text-xs` for captions and annotations; avoid `text-xl` unless for hero or major headings.
- Color Usage: Use 1 neutral base (e.g., `zinc`) and up to 2 accent colors. 
- Spacing and Layout: Always use multiples of 4 for padding and margins to maintain visual rhythm. Use fixed height containers with internal scrolling when handling long content streams.
- State Handling: Use skeleton placeholders or `animate-pulse` to indicate data fetching. Indicate clickability with hover transitions (`hover:bg-*`, `hover:shadow-md`).
- Accessibility: Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles where appropriate. Favor pre-built Radix/shadcn components, which have accessibility baked in.
<web_interface_guidelines>
## Interactions

- Keyboard
  - MUST: Full keyboard support per [WAI-ARIA APG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/)
  - MUST: Visible focus rings (`:focus-visible`; group with `:focus-within`)
  - MUST: Manage focus (trap, move, and return) per APG patterns
- Targets & input
  - MUST: Hit target ≥24px (mobile ≥44px) If visual <24px, expand hit area
  - MUST: Mobile `<input>` font-size ≥16px or set:
    ```html
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
    ```
  - NEVER: Disable browser zoom
  - MUST: `touch-action: manipulation` to prevent double-tap zoom; set `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` to match design
- Inputs & forms (behavior)
  - MUST: Hydration-safe inputs (no lost focus/value)
  - NEVER: Block paste in `<input>/<textarea>`
  - MUST: Loading buttons show spinner and keep original label
  - MUST: Enter submits focused text input In `<textarea>`, ⌘/Ctrl+Enter submits; Enter adds newline
  - MUST: Keep submit enabled until request starts; then disable, show spinner, use idempotency key
  - MUST: Don’t block typing; accept free text and validate after
  - MUST: Allow submitting incomplete forms to surface validation
  - MUST: Errors inline next to fields; on submit, focus first error
  - MUST: `autocomplete` + meaningful `name`; correct `type` and `inputmode`
  - SHOULD: Disable spellcheck for emails/codes/usernames
  - SHOULD: Placeholders end with ellipsis and show example pattern (eg, `+1 (123) 456-7890`, `sk-012345…`)
  - MUST: Warn on unsaved changes before navigation
  - MUST: Compatible with password managers & 2FA; allow pasting one-time codes
  - MUST: Trim values to handle text expansion trailing spaces
  - MUST: No dead zones on checkboxes/radios; label+control share one generous hit target
- State & navigation
  - MUST: URL reflects state (deep-link filters/tabs/pagination/expanded panels) Prefer libs like [nuqs](https://nuqs.dev)
  - MUST: Back/Forward restores scroll
  - MUST: Links are links—use `<a>/<Link>` for navigation (support Cmd/Ctrl/middle-click)
- Feedback
  - SHOULD: Optimistic UI; reconcile on response; on failure show error and rollback or offer Undo
  - MUST: Confirm destructive actions or provide Undo window
  - MUST: Use polite `aria-live` for toasts/inline validation
  - SHOULD: Ellipsis (`…`) for options that open follow-ups (eg, "Rename…") and loading states (eg, "Loading…", "Saving…", "Generating…")
- Touch/drag/scroll
  - MUST: Design forgiving interactions (generous targets, clear affordances; avoid finickiness)
  - MUST: Delay first tooltip in a group; subsequent peers no delay
  - MUST: Intentional `overscroll-behavior: contain` in modals/drawers
  - MUST: During drag, disable text selection and set `inert` on dragged element/containers
  - MUST: No “dead-looking” interactive zones—if it looks clickable, it is
- Autofocus
  - SHOULD: Autofocus on desktop when there’s a single primary input; rarely on mobile (to avoid layout shift)

## Animation

- MUST: Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (provide reduced variant)
- SHOULD: Prefer CSS > Web Animations API > JS libraries
- MUST: Animate compositor-friendly props (`transform`, `opacity`); avoid layout/repaint props (`top/left/width/height`)
- SHOULD: Animate only to clarify cause/effect or add deliberate delight
- SHOULD: Choose easing to match the change (size/distance/trigger)
- MUST: Animations are interruptible and input-driven (avoid autoplay)
- MUST: Correct `transform-origin` (motion starts where it “physically” should)

## Layout

- SHOULD: Optical alignment; adjust by ±1px when perception beats geometry
- MUST: Deliberate alignment to grid/baseline/edges/optical centers—no accidental placement
- SHOULD: Balance icon/text lockups (stroke/weight/size/spacing/color)
- MUST: Verify mobile, laptop, ultra-wide (simulate ultra-wide at 50% zoom)
- MUST: Respect safe areas (use env(safe-area-inset-*))
- MUST: Avoid unwanted scrollbars; fix overflows

## Content & Accessibility

- SHOULD: Inline help first; tooltips last resort
- MUST: Skeletons mirror final content to avoid layout shift
- MUST: `<title>` matches current context
- MUST: No dead ends; always offer next step/recovery
- MUST: Design empty/sparse/dense/error states
- SHOULD: Curly quotes (“ ”); avoid widows/orphans
- MUST: Tabular numbers for comparisons (`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` or a mono like Geist Mono)
- MUST: Redundant status cues (not color-only); icons have text labels
- MUST: Don’t ship the schema—visuals may omit labels but accessible names still exist
- MUST: Use the ellipsis character `…` (not ``)
- MUST: `scroll-margin-top` on headings for anchored links; include a “Skip to content” link; hierarchical `<h1–h6>`
- MUST: Resilient to user-generated content (short/avg/very long)
- MUST: Locale-aware dates/times/numbers/currency
- MUST: Accurate names (`aria-label`), decorative elements `aria-hidden`, verify in the Accessibility Tree
- MUST: Icon-only buttons have descriptive `aria-label`
- MUST: Prefer native semantics (`button`, `a`, `label`, `table`) before ARIA
- SHOULD: Right-clicking the nav logo surfaces brand assets
- MUST: Use non-breaking spaces to glue terms: `10&nbsp;MB`, `⌘&nbsp;+&nbsp;K`, `Vercel&nbsp;SDK`

## Performance

- SHOULD: Test iOS Low Power Mode and macOS Safari
- MUST: Measure reliably (disable extensions that skew runtime)
- MUST: Track and minimize re-renders (React DevTools/React Scan)
- MUST: Profile with CPU/network throttling
- MUST: Batch layout reads/writes; avoid unnecessary reflows/repaints
- MUST: Mutations (`POST/PATCH/DELETE`) target <500 ms
- SHOULD: Prefer uncontrolled inputs; make controlled loops cheap (keystroke cost)
- MUST: Virtualize large lists (eg, `virtua`)
- MUST: Preload only above-the-fold images; lazy-load the rest
- MUST: Prevent CLS from images (explicit dimensions or reserved space)

## Design

- SHOULD: Layered shadows (ambient + direct)
- SHOULD: Crisp edges via semi-transparent borders + shadows
- SHOULD: Nested radii: child ≤ parent; concentric
- SHOULD: Hue consistency: tint borders/shadows/text toward bg hue
- MUST: Accessible charts (color-blind-friendly palettes)
- MUST: Meet contrast—prefer [APCA](https://apcacontrast.com/) over WCAG 2
- MUST: Increase contrast on `:hover/:active/:focus`
- SHOULD: Match browser UI to bg
- SHOULD: Avoid gradient banding (use masks when needed)

<important_reminders>
**NEVER**:
- Use `--no-verify` to bypass commit hooks
- Disable tests instead of fixing them
- Commit code that doesn't compile
- Make assumptions - verify with existing code

**ALWAYS**:
- Commit working code incrementally
- Update plan documentation as you go
- Learn from existing implementations
- Stop after 3 failed attempts and reassess
